# RPOW Native CLI Portable

Portable command-line client for RPOW3 with a native C proof-of-work miner. It reproduces the site's browser API pipeline without opening the web UI: magic-link login, session cookies, challenge request, local C mining, minting, sending, activity and ledger queries.

This is an unofficial tool. Use it only with your own account and follow the service rules of the RPOW3 site.

## Features

- Uses the native C miner as the recommended mining engine.
- Includes the native C miner source and beginner-friendly build instructions.
- Uses Node.js 18+ only for CLI orchestration, HTTP requests and session handling.
- Supports magic-link login and local session persistence.
- Keeps a slower JavaScript miner only as a fallback.
- Resumes an unfinished challenge from the saved nonce when possible.
- Logs HTTP retries and mining progress without printing cookies or magic-link query strings.
- Restricts requests to the known RPOW3 site/API hosts.

Runtime state is stored in `.rpow-cli-state.json`. It contains account email, cookies/session data, current challenge and last mint metadata. Do not publish it.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or newer for the CLI wrapper.
- A native C miner binary built from `rpow-native-miner.c`:
  - Windows output name: `rpow-native-miner.exe`.
  - Linux/macOS output name: `rpow-native-miner`.
- Optional: gcc/clang if you want to rebuild the native C miner yourself.

Check Node.js:

```powershell
node -v
```

## Quick Start

Open PowerShell in the repository folder:

```powershell
.\build-native.ps1
node rpow-cli.js map
node rpow-cli.js login --email you@example.com
node rpow-cli.js complete-login --link "MAGIC_LINK_FROM_EMAIL"
node rpow-cli.js mine --count 1 --engine native
```

On macOS/Linux, build first with:

```bash
./build-native.sh
```

For a longer native C mining run:

```powershell
node rpow-cli.js mine --count 10 --workers 8 --engine native
```

If the native C miner is unavailable, use the slower JavaScript fallback:

```powershell
node rpow-cli.js mine --count 1 --workers 8 --engine node
```

## Native C Setup for Beginners

The CLI itself runs with Node.js, but mining should run through the C binary. Build the C miner once, keep the binary in the same folder as `rpow-cli.js`, then run the CLI with `--engine native`.

### Windows: Build the C Miner

Check that Node.js works:

```powershell
node -v
```

Install a C compiler if you do not have one:

1. Install MSYS2 from `https://www.msys2.org/`.
2. Open "MSYS2 MinGW x64" from the Start menu.
3. Install gcc:

```bash
pacman -S --needed mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc
```

Build from PowerShell if `gcc` is available in PATH:

```powershell
.\build-native.ps1
```

If PowerShell cannot find `gcc`, build from the MSYS2 MinGW x64 shell instead.

Go to the project folder. Example:

```bash
cd /c/Users/YOUR_NAME/Downloads/rpow-native-cli-portable
```

Build the C miner:

```bash
gcc -O3 -march=native -pthread rpow-native-miner.c -o rpow-native-miner.exe
```

Check that the binary exists:

```bash
ls -l rpow-native-miner.exe
```

Go back to PowerShell and run:

```powershell
node rpow-cli.js mine --count 1 --workers 8 --engine native
```

### Linux/macOS: Build the C Miner

Install a compiler first.

Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential nodejs
```

macOS with Xcode Command Line Tools:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Build the native C miner:

```bash
./build-native.sh
```

Run mining with the C engine:

```bash
node rpow-cli.js mine --count 1 --workers 8 --engine native
```

The CLI looks for `rpow-native-miner.exe` on Windows and `rpow-native-miner` on macOS/Linux. If no native binary exists, `--engine native` will fail and tell you to build the native miner.

## Commands

### `map`

Shows the API origin, endpoints found in `index.js`, and the actual pipeline used by the CLI.

```powershell
node rpow-cli.js map
```

### `login`

Requests a magic login link through `POST /auth/request`.

```powershell
node rpow-cli.js login --email you@example.com
```

If the API returns a rate limit, the command stops instead of repeatedly requesting email links.

### `complete-login`

Accepts the magic link from email, follows it, stores session cookies in the local state file and verifies the session through `GET /me`.

```powershell
node rpow-cli.js complete-login --link "https://..."
```

### `me`

Shows the current user, balance and counters. Requires an active session.

```powershell
node rpow-cli.js me
```

### `mine`

Runs the mining pipeline: `GET /me`, `POST /challenge`, local native C proof-of-work by default, `POST /mint`.

```powershell
node rpow-cli.js mine --count 1 --engine native
```

### `run`

Alias for `mine`, useful for multiple tokens.

```powershell
node rpow-cli.js run --count 3
```

### `send`

Sends RPOW to another email through `POST /send`. Requires an active session and balance.

```powershell
node rpow-cli.js send --to friend@example.com --amount 1
```

### `activity`

Shows account activity through `GET /activity`.

```powershell
node rpow-cli.js activity
```

### `ledger`

Shows public ledger statistics. No session is required.

```powershell
node rpow-cli.js ledger
```

### `logout`

Calls `POST /auth/logout` and clears local cookies.

```powershell
node rpow-cli.js logout
```

## Options

### `--state`

Path to the state file. Default: `.rpow-cli-state.json`.

```powershell
node rpow-cli.js mine --state .my-rpow-state.json
```

### `--timeout`

HTTP request timeout in milliseconds. Default: `20000`.

```powershell
node rpow-cli.js ledger --timeout 10000
```

### `--retries`

Number of retries for transient failures: timeout, `429`, `408`, `425`, `5xx`. Default: `5`.

```powershell
node rpow-cli.js mine --retries 8
```

### `--log-every-ms`

How often mining progress is logged and nonce progress is saved. Default: `5000`.

```powershell
node rpow-cli.js mine --log-every-ms 2000
```

### `--workers`

Number of CPU worker threads. By default the CLI uses up to 8 workers while leaving one logical CPU for the system.

```powershell
node rpow-cli.js mine --workers 8
```

If the system becomes unresponsive, lower the value:

```powershell
node rpow-cli.js mine --workers 4
```

### `--engine`

Mining engine: `native` or `node`. `native` is the recommended engine. If `rpow-native-miner.exe` is present, the CLI uses `native` by default.

```powershell
node rpow-cli.js mine --engine native --workers 8
node rpow-cli.js mine --engine node --workers 8
```

### `--fresh`

Ignores a saved challenge and requests a fresh one through `POST /challenge`.

```powershell
node rpow-cli.js mine --fresh
```

### `--verbose`

Enables detailed HTTP logs.

```powershell
node rpow-cli.js mine --verbose
```

Or with an environment variable:

```powershell
$env:RPOW_VERBOSE=1
node rpow-cli.js mine
```

Disable colors:

```powershell
$env:NO_COLOR=1
node rpow-cli.js mine
```

## Native C Miner

The repository is intended to be used with the native C miner. Build it from source before using `--engine native`.

Windows:

```powershell
.\build-native.ps1
```

Linux/macOS:

```bash
./build-native.sh
```

The JavaScript engine exists only as a slower fallback for systems without a compiled miner.

## Logs and Privacy

Verbose HTTP logs use this shape:

```text
HTTP -> method/url/attempt/has_body/has_cookie
HTTP <- method/url/attempt/status/ms/set_cookie/retry_after_ms
```

Cookies and magic-link query strings are not printed.

Mining progress logs look like this:

```text
mining hashes=... nonce=... workers=8 engine=native speed="21.00 MH/s"
```

## Retry and Resume Behavior

The CLI retries transient request failures with exponential backoff and jitter.

`POST /auth/request` is handled conservatively: on rate limit, the CLI stops and asks you to wait instead of spamming email requests.

The state file stores cookies, current challenge, nonce progress and last mint metadata. If mining stops unexpectedly, rerun:

```powershell
node rpow-cli.js mine --count 1
```

The CLI will resume from the saved nonce if the challenge is still valid.

## API Pipeline

The site frontend currently uses:

```text
POST /auth/request   { email }
GET  /me
POST /challenge
POST /mint           { challenge_id, solution_nonce }
POST /send           { recipient_email, amount, idempotency_key }
GET  /activity
GET  /ledger
POST /auth/logout
```

For minting, the CLI requests a challenge, mines `SHA-256(nonce_prefix || uint64-le nonce)` locally, then submits the solution through `POST /mint`.

## Security Notes

The CLI allows requests only to these hosts:

```text
api.rpow3.com
rpow3.com
www.rpow3.com
```

Before publishing or sharing a build, make sure `.rpow-cli-state.json` is not included.
